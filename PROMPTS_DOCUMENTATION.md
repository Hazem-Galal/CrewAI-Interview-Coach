## 🚀 Extending the Prompt System

When creating additional agents:

2. Specify distinct methodology or framework
3. Establish communication style and personality
4. Create clear assessment criteria
5. Define expected output format

### Example: Panel Interviewer Agent

    role=f"Panel Interview Coordinator at {company}",
    goal="Facilitate multi-stakeholder interview with diverse perspectives",
    backstory=f"""You coordinate panel interviews with 3-4 interviewers 
    from different departments. You ensure:
    - Each panelist asks questions from their domain expertise
    - No repetition across panelists
    - Balanced assessment of technical and cultural fit
    - Efficient use of candidate's time
    
    Panelist roles: Engineering Manager, Senior Engineer, Product Manager, HR
    You facilitate natural conversation while ensuring comprehensive coverage.""",
    llm=llm
)
```

### Customizing for Industry Verticals

**Example: Startup Interview Variant**
```python
backstory = f"""You're interviewing for a Series A startup where:
- Scrappiness and resourcefulness matter more than perfect processes
- Wearing multiple hats is expected
- Fast learning and adaptability are critical
